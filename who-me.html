          <p>Before we get into the impressive stuff, a few things you should know:</p>
          <p>This person once spent three hours perfecting a font pairing that nobody noticed. She has strong opinions about Oxford commas. Her Spotify Wrapped is 90% podcast episodes about branding. She has never, not once, posted an Instagram story without checking the preview at least four times.</p>
          <p>She once cried over a Canva template. It was that ugly.</p>
          <p>If any of that sounds relatable — or deeply concerning — keep scrolling. It only gets better from here.</p>

          <p>It started in Indore, a city in central India known for its street food and its spirit. Between 2010 and 2012, a curious mind earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya — learning the language of business, strategy, and the art of getting things done.</p>
          <p>But classrooms could only contain so much ambition. By 2013, a deeper fascination took hold — one with live experiences, crowd energy, and the magic of events. A Post Graduate Diploma in Event Management and Public Relations from the Prestige Institute of Management and Research became the bridge between knowing about business and actually creating moments that people remember.</p>

          <p>Every scroll, every post, every piece of data told a story. Social media wasn't just a channel — it was a canvas. Monitoring trends, refining strategy, pushing creative limits — this was the daily rhythm, and it never got old.</p>

          <p>Directing multiple projects simultaneously. Defining scopes, timelines, and budgets. Leading cross-functional teams of designers, writers, and marketers. Working with finance stakeholders to keep things lean and efficient. Three years of building something from nothing — and proving that great work doesn't need a big name behind it.</p>
